        history: "Legend, the reggae masterpiece by Bob Marley and the Wailers, stands as an indomitable force in the musical realm. This compilation album, unleashed upon the world by Island Records in May 1984, isn't just a collection of tracks—it's a sonic journey through the very heartbeat of reggae. With over 12 million copies rocking the charts in the US, 3.3 million jamming in the UK (clinching the 17th best-selling spot), and a staggering 25 million global groovers, Legend is the undisputed reggae monarch. In the hallowed halls of music history, Legend commands respect, securing its place at number 46 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. It held its ground in the 2012 revision but gracefully slid to 48th place in the 2020 update. As of December 16, 2023, this reggae giant has been kicking it on the US Billboard 200 for a jaw-dropping 812 weeks, marking the second-longest run in the chart's storied history. Across the pond, in the UK, it's a chart-topper, boasting a triumphant 1,111 weeks in the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart—an awe-inspiring achievement and the third-longest run in the chart's archives. Legend isn't just an album; it's a legend in its own right, etching its musical saga into the annals of time.",

        content: `The album contains all ten of Bob Marley's Top 40 hit singles in the UK up to the time,[11] plus three songs from the original Wailers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston in "Stir It Up," "I Shot the Sheriff," and "Get Up, Stand Up," along with the closing song from the album Uprising, "Redemption Song." Of the original tracks, only four date from prior to the Exodus album. The cassette tape release of the album featured two extra songs, "Punky Reggae Party," the B-side to the "Jamming" single, and "Easy Skanking" from the Kaya album. A second generation compact disc remastered by Barry Diament appeared in 1990 on the Tuff Gong label. Although the disc includes the same 14 songs, the tracks are in their original album lengths rather than the edited versions for single release.[citation needed] On 12 February 2002, the expanded 14-track edition with songs at album lengths were remastered for compact disc with a bonus disc consisting of 1984-vintage remixes for extended dance club singles and dub versions. In 2004, the Legend double-disc deluxe edition was reissued with the music DVD of the same name in the sound + vision deluxe edition. In 2010, Legend was made available as downloadable content for Rock Band. However, it was released without "Get Up, Stand Up," which was later included on Rock Band 3. In June 2012, a high fidelity audiophile version of the album was released on HDtracks in 96 kHz/24bit and 192 kHz/24bit resolutions. Bruno Tilley was the Art Director & Creative Consultant for the sleeve design work.`,
